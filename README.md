# Impact of Planned Works EDA Project

## Overview

This project aims to present the impact of planned works, including traffic management and structural changes, to the city council. Planned works have the potential to significantly affect the flow of traffic and the overall mobility of citizens within the City of Melbourne (CoM). By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets sourced from [Melbourne Open Data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/pages/home/), this project seeks to provide insights that support the CoM in minimizing disruptions, enhancing safety, and optimizing traffic flow.

## Objectives

- **Developments Management**: Analyze historical data and current trends to make informed decisions regarding timeline and resource allocation for planned works.
- **Facilitate Strategic Traffic Management**: Utilize insights to devise alternative traffic routes, provide advance notice to commuters, or schedule works during non-peak hours to reduce the impact on travel.
- **Enhance Safety Protocols**: Implement safety measures such as temporary signage to ensure the safety of road users during construction or maintenance activities.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are sourced from the Melbourne Open Data platform. These datasets contain information relevant to planned works, including but not limited to:
- [City Activities and Planned Works](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/city-activities-and-planned-works/table/?disjunctive.classification&disjunctive.small_area)
- [Development Activity Model Footprints](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/development-activity-model-footprints/table/)
- [Development Activity Monitor](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/development-activity-monitor/table/)

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather datasets from Melbourne Open Data platform.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the datasets to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the datasets to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to planned works and their impact on traffic.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the findings using charts, graphs, and maps to effectively communicate insights.
5. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze the implications of planned works on traffic flow, mobility, and safety within the CoM.
6. **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations to the city council based on the analysis to improve developments management, traffic management, and safety protocols.

## Conclusion

Through this EDA project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the impact of planned works on traffic within the City of Melbourne. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we can assist the city council in making informed decisions to minimize disruptions, enhance safety, and optimize traffic flow for the benefit of all citizens.
